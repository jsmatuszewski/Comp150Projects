/*	Computer Science 150 - Fall 2017
This program is designed to compute the pounds of green crud after a given number of days. The user indicates the initial number of pounds and number of days the crud has to reprod$
        To the best of our knowledge, our project works. It is complete, was submitted
online and on time, it was written correctly, and completely.
